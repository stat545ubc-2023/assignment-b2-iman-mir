# counter

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of counter is to determine the count of different data points in a group within a data frame. 

In order to create the function, I used the R packages of dplyr,tidyverse, devtools and datateachr. 

```{r}
library(devtools)
library(dplyr)
library(datateachr)
```


## Installation

You can install the development version of counter from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("iman-mir/counter")

```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
#basic example code
library(counter)
counter(vancouver_trees, height_range_id)
```

## Files explanation 
1. The description file provides metadata about the counter package
2. The namespace file is the package export for external use and the external functions the counter package imports from other packages
3. The man file contains the counter.rd file with the function definition
4. The R file contains the counter.R file with the function definition
5. The tests and nested testthat file contains test-counter.R which is a file with different tests of the counter function
